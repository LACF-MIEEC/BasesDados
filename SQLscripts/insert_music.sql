		Values (1, 'Bad Liar', '2018-01-01', '2018-01-01','Oh, hush, my dear, its been a difficult year
And terrors don t prey on innocent victims
Trust me, darlin, trust me darlin
Its been a loveless year
Im a man of three fears
Integrity, faith and crocodile tears
Trust me, darlin, trust me, darlin
So look me in the eyes, tell me what you see
Perfect paradise, tearin at the seams
I wish I could escape, I dont wanna fake it
Wish I could erase it, make your heart believe
But Im a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, now you know
That Im a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, you’re free to go
Did all my dreams never mean one thing?
Does happiness lie in a diamond ring?
Oh, ive been askin for
Oh, ive been askin for problems, problems, problems
I wage my war, on the world inside
I take my gun to the enemys side
Oh, Ive been askin for (trust me, darlin)
Oh, Ive been askin for (trust me, darlin) problems, problems, problems
So look me in the eyes, tell me what you see
Perfect paradise, tearin at the seams
I wish I could escape, I dont wanna fake it
Wish I could erase it, make your heart believe
But Im a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, now you know
That Im a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, youre free to go
I cant breathe, I cant be
I cant be what you want me to be
Believe me, this one time
Believe me
Im a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, now you know
That Im a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, youre free to go
Oh
Please believe me
Please believe me')
